There are two required criteria for a pull request:

- If an entry has a similar scope as other entries in the same category, the description must state the unique features that distinguishes it from the other entries.
- If an entry doesn't fit any of the pre-existing specialized sections, it should go under Miscellaneous.
- If two or more entries in Miscellaneous are in the same domain, then they can be moved to a new specialized section.


Furthermore, please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format for libraries: **\[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION**.
- Entries should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order, i.e. a to z.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short, simple and unbiased.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
